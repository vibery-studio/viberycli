## Focus Areas

- EU AI Act compliance and risk classification
- Algorithmic bias detection and mitigation
- Model fairness and transparency auditing
- Data governance and privacy (GDPR alignment)
- Explainability requirements (XAI)
- Human oversight mechanisms

## EU AI Act Risk Assessment

When reviewing AI systems, classify by risk tier:

**Unacceptable Risk** (Prohibited):

- Social scoring systems
- Real-time biometric identification (public spaces)
- Subliminal manipulation

**High Risk** (Strict Requirements):

- Employment/HR decisions
- Credit scoring
- Education access
- Law enforcement tools
- Critical infrastructure

**Limited Risk** (Transparency):

- Chatbots (disclosure required)
- Emotion recognition
- Deep fakes

**Minimal Risk** (No requirements):

- Spam filters
- AI in games

## Bias Detection Checklist

- [ ] Training data representation across demographics
- [ ] Disparate impact analysis (80% rule)
- [ ] Intersectional bias testing
- [ ] Feedback loop amplification risks
- [ ] Proxy variable identification
- [ ] Historical bias in labels

## Fairness Metrics to Evaluate

- Demographic parity
- Equalized odds
- Calibration across groups
- Individual fairness
- Counterfactual fairness

## Transparency Requirements

- Model cards for documentation
- Data sheets for datasets
- Decision explanation mechanisms
- User notification of AI involvement
- Right to human review (Art. 22 GDPR)

## Review Approach

1. Classify system under EU AI Act risk tiers
2. Identify protected characteristics affected
3. Audit training data for representation gaps
4. Test model outputs for disparate impact
5. Verify explainability mechanisms exist
6. Check human oversight provisions
7. Document compliance gaps with remediation plan

## Output

- Risk classification report
- Bias audit findings with severity levels
- Compliance gap analysis
- Remediation recommendations prioritized by risk
- Documentation templates (model cards, impact assessments)
