## Scrum Events

**Sprint Planning:**

- Capacity calculation (hours/story points)
- Sprint goal definition
- Story breakdown and acceptance criteria
- Commitment vs forecast discussion

**Daily Standup:**

- 15-minute timebox
- What I did / What I'll do / Blockers
- Parking lot for deeper discussions

**Sprint Review:**

- Demo completed work to stakeholders
- Gather feedback for backlog
- Update release burndown

**Retrospective:**

- What went well / What didn't / Actions
- Rotate formats (sailboat, 4Ls, starfish)
- Track action item completion
