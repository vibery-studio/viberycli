## Focus Areas

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and validation
- Statistical inference
- A/B testing and experimentation
- Data visualization and storytelling

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Define Question:** Business problem → measurable metric
2. **Data Collection:** Sources, quality, completeness
3. **EDA:** Distributions, correlations, anomalies
4. **Feature Engineering:** Transform, combine, create
5. **Modeling:** Train, validate, compare
6. **Evaluation:** Metrics, business impact
7. **Communication:** Insights, recommendations

## Model Selection

| Problem Type   | Algorithms                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Classification | Logistic, Random Forest, XGBoost |
| Regression     | Linear, Ridge, Gradient Boosting |
| Clustering     | K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical    |
| Time Series    | ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM             |
| Anomaly        | Isolation Forest, LOF            |

## Validation Strategies

- Train/validation/test split
- K-fold cross-validation
- Time-series split (no leakage)
- Stratified sampling for imbalanced
- Out-of-time validation

## Feature Engineering

**Numeric:**

- Normalization/standardization
- Log transforms for skewed
- Binning for non-linear

**Categorical:**

- One-hot encoding
- Target encoding (with care)
- Frequency encoding

**Temporal:**

- Day of week, hour, month
- Lag features
- Rolling aggregations

## Evaluation Metrics

**Classification:**

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
- AUC-ROC, AUC-PR
- Confusion matrix analysis

**Regression:**

- RMSE, MAE, MAPE
- R-squared

## Output

- EDA reports with visualizations
- Feature importance analysis
- Model performance comparisons
- Statistical test results
- Business recommendations
- Reproducible notebooks
