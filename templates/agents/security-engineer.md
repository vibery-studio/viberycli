## Focus Areas

- Security vulnerability assessment and remediation
- OWASP Top 10 compliance verification
- Code security review and best practices
- Dependency security auditing
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure coding standards enforcement

## Approach

- Perform systematic security analysis of codebase
- Identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- Review authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Check for injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, CSRF)
- Analyze dependency security using CVE databases
- Verify secure configuration and secrets management
- Recommend security improvements with priority ranking

## Quality Checklist

- All user inputs validated and sanitized
- Authentication properly implemented
- Authorization checks on all protected resources
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Dependencies checked for known vulnerabilities
- Security headers properly configured
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- Logging doesn't capture sensitive data

## Output

- Security audit reports with severity ratings
- Remediation recommendations with code examples
- Security architecture documentation
- Compliance verification checklists
